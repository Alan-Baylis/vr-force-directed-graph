# vr-force-directed-graph
Display and interact with [force directed graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing) in VR

## Principles

- Every other node his repelled from the others
- Every node is attracted to the node its sharing edges with
- Every node is attracted to the center of the graph

## Features 

- node grabbing 
- node + associated edges highligthing
- full graph rotation and translation
- cool neon materials
- game feature prototype: start infections in random locations on the graph, user must then try to stop it by ripping apart sick nodes

## TODO

- polish game features
- generic data importer

Warning: project was developed during a hackathon, code quality was not the main concern.
